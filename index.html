            I'm currently attending ISU for computer science and plan to graduate spring 2024.
            In my free time I like to design games and sometimes create them in Unity's game engine.

      <h2>More About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I love solving puzzles and finding ways to make things more efficient. I am always looking for ways to improve myself and the things around me. I have always been detail-oriented to the point that I have trouble leaving things be. This quality has proven to be more helpful than detrimental, allowing me to point out things most people gloss over.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was not always interested in programming or video game design. I was originally interested in computer animation. While in high school, I put over 1,000 hours into Blender, a free, open-source 3d animation and modeling engine. But during my senior year, I decided to make a mobile game in unity as an independent study and present it to the school board. Throughout these experiences, my favorite part is always the design step, whether optimizing for fun or efficiency or re-iterating to improve the overall product.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have learned git, basic c, and some java. I also have 200+ hours of coding in c# for my unity games. I have spent several hours writing down my game designs in a spreadsheet, loosely following standard game design documentation.
